# Kernel
Like already mentioned in the linux-architecture part, the kernel is the core of the OS. 
Check out the following diagram regarding the linux kernel mapping:

## Kernel Types
There are multiple types of kernels. Linux for example has a kernel of the "monolithic" type, Windows NT on the other hand a "hybrid" one.
Every type has its advantages and disadvantages that fit their specific usecase.
If you are interested in a overview of operating systems and the kernel they use, check this out:

### Monolithic 
Kernels of the monolithic type are 



### Microkernel


### Hybrid 


### Exokernel

## User Mode vs Kernel Mode
To fully understand the aforementioned advantages and disadvantages of the different kernel types it is important to know the two key states in a operating system. 
These two states, or also user mode and kernel mode have very different usecases due to how they affect security, stability and performance

### User Mode

### Kernel Mode
