# Linux Architectuce & How to rice / rice components 
A extensive wall of text regarding the architecture of unix/linux and the components of ricing
Includes my sources(in the sources.md file), additional links and resources. 


## Why am i doing this ?
Due to career path and win10 EOL i chose to switch to linux. I started with "ricing" my arch almost instantly and faced a lot of challenges.
While the individual Wm wikis are helpful i was missing some kind of general overview regarding the components and how they communicate with each other. 
I personally dislike it, when i dont fully understand something. Therefore i extended the documentation past the "limits" of ricing, towards the general linux architecture.
