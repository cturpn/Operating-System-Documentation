# Linux & Ricing Glossary
Partially AI generated, separated the AI part from manually written stuff. 
Im aware that no sane person is gonna read this, but on my journey reading hundreds of wikis and blogs, learning the basics of a operating system and ricing, i realized that many terms i thought to understand, were not as clear as expected

## Manual Entries

### Application vs Program 
Program

 - General term: any set of instructions written in a programming language that a computer can execute.
 - Doesn’t imply purpose, scope, or audience.
 - Could be a system utility, a background daemon, a compiler, a driver, or even a script.
 - Example: ls in Linux is a program, your custom Python script is a program.

Application (App)

 - Subset of programs specifically designed to perform tasks for the end user.
 - Has a user-facing purpose (productivity, communication, entertainment, etc.).
 - Relies on lower-level programs and OS services.
 - Example: a web browser, game, or text editor.

Every application is a program, but not every program is an application.

Your GPU driver = program, but not an app.
Firefox = application (and also a program).
Kernel = program, but definitely not an app.

### Core Linux Terms

TTY – Teletype terminal (console interface)
PTTY – Pseudo terminal (virtual terminal emulation)
VT – Virtual terminal (switchable terminal sessions, e.g., Ctrl+Alt+F2)
Shell – Command interpreter (e.g., Bash, Zsh, Fish)
WM – Window Manager (manages placement/behavior of windows; e.g., i3, bspwm)
DE – Desktop Environment (full suite: WM + panels + apps, e.g., GNOME, KDE)
DM – Display Manager (login/graphical session manager, e.g., GDM, LightDM)
X11 – Old Linux display server protocol (X.Org implementation)
Wayland – Modern replacement for X11 (more secure, simpler protocol)
Compositor – Draws + blends windows (needed for transparency, shadows, etc.)
Init – First process on boot (SysVinit, systemd, OpenRC)
PkgMgr – Package Manager (e.g., pacman, apt, dnf)
AUR – Arch User Repository (community PKGBUILDs for Arch)
Dotfiles – User configuration files (e.g., .bashrc, .config/i3/config)
$PATH – Environment variable telling shell where to look for executables

### Ricing Terms

Ricing – Customizing your Linux look & feel (term from “riced-up cars”)
GTK – GIMP Toolkit (widget library used by GNOME apps)
Qt – GUI framework (used by KDE apps)
Icon Theme – Pack of icons (system-wide or app-specific)
Cursor Theme – Custom mouse pointer styles
Colorscheme – Palette used across editor, terminal, WM, etc.
Nerd Fonts – Patched fonts with icons/glyphs for status bars and terminals
Bar/Panel – Status bar/taskbar (e.g., polybar, lemonbar, waybar)
Launcher – App runner menu (e.g., rofi, dmenu, wofi)
Terminal Emulator – GUI program emulating a TTY (e.g., alacritty, kitty)
Transparency/Picom – Window compositor effect for see-through backgrounds
Wallpaper Daemon – Tool to set/manage wallpapers (e.g., feh, nitrogen)
